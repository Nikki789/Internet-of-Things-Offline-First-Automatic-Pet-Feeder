# Internet-of-Things-Offline-First-Automatic-Pet-Feeder
IoT solution that works automatically to provide feed for pets.

Components: Arduino Elegoo Uno, ESP8266 ESP-01, Real Time Clock RTC DS3231, and SG90 Micro-servo motor.

The project is currently in development, as the ESP8266 ESP-01 component receives the IP address but does not receive the time value.

The user can enter a hardcoded time value,  which corresponds to the time that the pet would be fed and the food valve will open at the specified time.
